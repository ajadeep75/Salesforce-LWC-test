The 2 applications are built on Lightning Web Components which are used to develop the applications. Lightning Web Components are the same as HTML which consists of opening and closing of tags such as <template> which is the main tag in which we can add other component tags such as <lightning-card> and <lightning-layout multiple-rows>. In the meta-xml file, we need to specify the targets so that the particular components can be added to the record page or home page.

Simple Interest Calculator application is developed to display the simple interest calculated from the principal, time and rate of interest. The principal, time and rate of interest field values are taken from the user with the help of input fields and are calculated with the help of the formula <br>
S.I = P*T*R/100

Shape Calculator application is developed to calculate the area of the square, rectangle and rhombus. The side of the square, the length and breadth of rectangle and the diagonals of rhombus values are taken from the user with the help of input fields and are calculated with the help of the formula.

Area of square = (side)^2  <br>
Area of rectangle = length*breadth <br>
Area of rhombus = (d1*d2)/2

The above 2 applications are built to test my proficiency in Lightning Web Components
